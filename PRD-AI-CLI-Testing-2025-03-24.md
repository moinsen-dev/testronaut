## 1. Executive Summary

AI-CLI-Testing is an innovative tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the end-to-end testing of command-line interface (CLI) applications. By leveraging large language models, it eliminates the need for manual test script writing and maintenance, while providing more robust and comprehensive test coverage that simulates real user interactions.

The MVP focuses on delivering core functionality: analyzing CLI tools, generating comprehensive test plans, executing tests in isolated Docker environments, and verifying results using AI-assisted semantic comparison.

## 2. Problem Statement

Testing CLI applications presents unique challenges:
- Manual test creation is time-consuming and error-prone
- String-based matching is brittle and maintenance-intensive
- Test coverage is often limited and doesn't simulate real user interactions
- CI/CD integration for CLI tools is complex and inconsistent

The AI-CLI-Testing tool directly addresses these pain points by automating the entire testing process from analysis to verification, enabling developers to ensure their CLI tools work as expected with minimal manual effort.

## 3. Target Audience

Primary users are:
- CLI tool developers needing automated testing
- DevOps engineers maintaining CLI tools in CI/CD pipelines
- QA engineers responsible for command-line tool quality
- Open-source maintainers who need scalable testing solutions

## 4. MVP Core Features

### 4.1 CLI Analysis Engine
- Automatically parse CLI tool structure and commands
- Extract command syntax, options, arguments, and help text
- Identify command relationships and dependencies
- Leverage AI to understand tool semantics and usage patterns

### 4.2 Test Plan Generator
- Create comprehensive test plans based on command analysis
- Generate test cases covering various input combinations
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Allow user review and modification of generated plans

### 4.3 Docker-based Test Execution
- Automatically install CLI tools in isolated containers
- Execute test plans in controlled environments
- Capture outputs (stdout, stderr, files, exit codes)
- Support two modes: generate-expected and verification

### 4.4 AI-assisted Result Verification
- Compare actual outputs to expected results
- Use AI for semantic comparison rather than exact matching
- Handle dynamic output elements (timestamps, UUIDs, etc.)
- Generate detailed test reports

### 4.5 Model Flexibility
- Support both cloud-based and local LLMs
- Optimize for cost efficiency with model selection options
- Default to local models for routine testing

## 5. User Experience

### 5.1 Command-line Interface
The tool itself will be a CLI application with this usage pattern:

```
ai-cli-test [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --tool TEXT                  CLI tool to test (name or path)
  --install-cmd TEXT           Command to install the tool
  --model TEXT                 LLM to use (openai, anthropic, or local model path)
  --output-dir TEXT            Directory to store results
  --docker-image TEXT          Custom Docker image to use

Commands:
  analyze      Analyze CLI tool and generate test plan
  generate     Execute tests and generate expected results
  verify       Execute tests and verify against expected results
  report       Generate test report from results
```

### 5.2 User Workflow

1. **Setup**: User specifies the CLI tool to test
2. **Analysis**: Tool analyzes the CLI and generates a test plan
3. **Review**: User reviews and optionally modifies the test plan
4. **Generation**: Tool executes the plan and captures expected outputs
5. **Verification**: Tool re-executes tests and compares to expected results
6. **Reporting**: Tool generates a comprehensive test report

## 6. Technical Architecture

### 6.1 Component Architecture

The system consists of five main components:

1. **CLI Analyzer**
   - Parses command structure and options
   - Uses AI to understand command semantics
   - Generates structured command metadata

2. **Test Plan Generator**
   - Creates test cases based on command analysis
   - Builds test sequences for related commands
   - Includes edge cases and error conditions

3. **Test Executor**
   - Sets up Docker containers
   - Installs CLI tools
   - Executes commands and captures outputs

4. **Result Verifier**
   - Compares expected vs. actual results
   - Uses AI for semantic comparison
   - Handles dynamic content in outputs

5. **LLM Integration Layer**
   - Manages communication with LLMs
   - Supports both cloud and local models
   - Optimizes prompts for accurate results

### 6.2 Technology Stack

Following best practices and user preferences:

- **Backend**: Python 3.13 with FastAPI
- **Package Management**: uv with pyproject.toml
- **Database**: SQLite for test plans and results
- **AI Integration**: LangChain for LLM orchestration
- **Containerization**: Docker for test isolation
- **Testing**: pytest for the tool itself
- **Documentation**: MkDocs for user and developer docs

### 6.3 Data Model

The system operates on these primary entities:

1. **CLITool**
   - Name, version, installation command
   - Commands, options, and arguments
   - Help text and usage patterns

2. **TestPlan**
   - Collection of test cases
   - Generated from CLI analysis
   - Associated with a specific CLI tool version

3. **TestCase**
   - Command to execute
   - Input parameters and values
   - Expected outputs and exit codes
   - Dependencies on other test cases

4. **TestResult**
   - Actual command outputs
   - Comparison results
   - Pass/fail status
   - Execution metadata

5. **TestReport**
   - Summary statistics
   - Detailed results
   - Recommendations for improvements
