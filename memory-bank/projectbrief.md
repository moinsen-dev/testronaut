# Project Brief: Testronaut

## Project Overview
Testronaut is an AI-powered, containerized framework for end-to-end testing of command-line interface (CLI) tools. It leverages large language models to analyze CLI tools, generate comprehensive test plans, execute tests in isolated Docker containers, and verify results using semantic comparison.

## Core Goals
1. Eliminate manual test script writing and maintenance for CLI tools
2. Provide more robust and comprehensive test coverage
3. Simulate real user interactions with CLI tools
4. Ensure safe and reproducible test execution through containerization
5. Support both cloud and local LLMs for flexibility and cost efficiency

## Target Audience
- CLI tool developers needing automated testing
- DevOps engineers maintaining CLI tools in CI/CD pipelines
- QA engineers responsible for command-line tool quality
- Open-source maintainers who need scalable testing solutions

## Key Features
1. **CLI Analysis Engine**: Automatically understand command structure and semantics
2. **Test Plan Generator**: Create comprehensive test plans with minimal input
3. **Docker-based Test Execution**: Run tests in isolated environments
4. **AI-assisted Result Verification**: Compare outputs based on meaning, not exact matches
5. **Model Flexibility**: Support for both cloud and local LLMs
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports and insights

## Success Metrics
1. **Functionality**: Successfully analyzes, generates tests, and verifies results for common CLI tools
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces manual testing effort by at least 70%
3. **Accuracy**: Achieves >90% accuracy in test verification
4. **Performance**: Completes analysis and verification within reasonable timeframes (minutes, not hours)
5. **Adoption**: At least 3 internal projects using the tool successfully

## Current Status
The project is in early development with initial setup in progress (Phase 000). A comprehensive implementation plan has been defined with 11 phases from project setup to integration and release.
