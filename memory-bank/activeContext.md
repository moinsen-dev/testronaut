## Current Focus

We have successfully completed Phase 002: CI/CD Pipeline. All the continuous integration and continuous delivery infrastructure is now in place. We've automated testing, code quality checks, security scanning, and documentation generation processes.

### Completed Phase 002 Tasks

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows for:
   - Automated testing on PR merge
   - Linting and code quality checks
   - Documentation generation and publishing
   - Release management
   - Security scanning and vulnerability detection

2. Implemented modern Python project tooling:
   - Using astral-sh/setup-uv@v5 action for dependency management
   - Configured ruff for linting
   - Set up mypy for type checking
   - Implemented pre-commit hooks

3. Established documentation infrastructure:
   - Using MkDocs with Material theme
   - Set up automatic API documentation
   - Created user guides and references
   - Added detailed CLI and configuration reference documentation

4. Created local CI/CD testing tools:
   - Docker-based workflow testing with Act
   - Individual component testing scripts
   - Security scanning validation tools
   - Documentation build verification

### Recent Decisions

- We've decided to run CI workflows only on PR merge to main/master branch to reduce resource usage
- We're using the latest GitHub Actions: actions/checkout@v4.2.2 and actions/setup-python@v5
- We're using the official astral-sh/setup-uv@v5 action instead of a manual setup
- We've standardized on Python 3.13 for build and documentation jobs
- We're still running the test matrix on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 for compatibility
- We've implemented comprehensive security scanning with Safety, Bandit, and CodeQL
- Security scanning runs on a weekly schedule and on dependency changes
- We've created comprehensive documentation with detailed API references and CLI usage guides
- We've implemented local testing tools for CI workflows to validate changes before pushing
- We've created utility scripts with virtual environments for security scanning and documentation building

### Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 003: Core Architecture
   - Implement the domain-driven design architecture
   - Build core business logic layers
   - Create data models and repositories
   - Implement dependency injection system
2. Create detailed architectural documentation

## Development Context

The project is using a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns. We're focusing on maintainable, testable code with high coverage and clear documentation.

### Current Status

- Phase 001 (Testing Infrastructure) is complete
- Phase 002 (CI/CD Pipeline) is complete
- The codebase has good test coverage (72%) and passing tests
- Ready to begin Phase 003 (Core Architecture)

## Recent Activities
1. Completed project directory structure following domain-driven design
2. Implemented modular CLI interface with Typer
3. Set up dependency management with UV
4. Created development environment with pre-commit hooks
5. Implemented initial unit tests with 48% code coverage
6. Added comprehensive documentation for developers

## Current Tasks
1. Unit Testing Framework
   - [x] Set up pytest configuration
   - [x] Create basic test fixtures
   - [x] Implement initial unit tests for CLI
   - [x] Implement initial unit tests for analyzer
   - [ ] Complete comprehensive unit tests for all modules
   - [ ] Create mock objects for external dependencies
   - [ ] Achieve at least 80% code coverage

2. Integration Testing Framework
   - [ ] Set up integration test structure
   - [ ] Create database test fixtures
   - [ ] Implement component interaction tests
   - [ ] Create mock LLM service for testing

3. Functional Testing Framework
   - [ ] Design workflow-based testing approach
   - [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios
   - [ ] Implement CLI interaction testing
   - [ ] Set up Docker test environment

4. Coverage and Reporting
   - [x] Configure basic coverage reporting
   - [ ] Enhance coverage measurement
   - [ ] Set up report generation in different formats
   - [ ] Create coverage enforcement rules

## Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Decisions
1. **Python Version**: Using Python 3.13 for latest features and performance
2. **Package Management**: Using uv for speed and reliability
3. **CLI Framework**: Using Typer for type-safe CLI development
4. **Testing Framework**: Using pytest with pytest-cov for coverage
5. **Code Quality**: Using ruff for linting and formatting
6. **Static Type Checking**: Using mypy for type checking

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Components with well-defined interfaces
2. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
3. **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
4. **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible implementations
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
6. **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains

### Resolved Decisions
1. **Package Management**: Chosen uv over pip/poetry for speed and reliability
2. **Code Formatting**: Chosen ruff over black for linting and formatting
3. **Test Framework**: Chosen pytest over unittest for flexibility and plugins

### Pending Decisions
1. **CI/CD Provider**: Evaluating GitHub Actions vs. alternatives
2. **Documentation Generator**: Considering MkDocs vs. Sphinx
3. **Default LLM Provider**: Evaluating OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. local models

## Blockers & Challenges
1. **Docker Integration**: Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
2. **LLM Cost Management**: Optimizing LLM usage to control costs
3. **Testing Approach**: Designing tests for AI-based systems
4. **Mocking LLM Responses**: Creating realistic test fixtures for LLM

## Active Discussions
1. Best practices for testing LLM interactions
2. Strategies for mocking Docker containers in tests
3. Approaches for semantic comparison in test verification
4. Performance optimization for LLM-based tests
