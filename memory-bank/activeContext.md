# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently focused on Phase 5: Test Plan Generator. Having completed the core architecture (Phase 3) and CLI analysis engine (Phase 4), we're now working on:

1. **Test Plan Generation**: Building the component that creates test plans from CLI analysis results
2. **LLM Integration for Test Cases**: Using LLM services to generate comprehensive test cases
3. **Expected Output Prediction**: Implementing functionality to predict expected outputs for commands

This phase leverages our completed CLI analyzer and LLM integration to automatically generate test cases based on the structure of CLI tools.

## Most Recent Phase Completion

### Phase 4: CLI Analysis Engine - Completed
We've successfully implemented the CLI Analysis Engine, which can:
- Extract commands, subcommands, options, and arguments from CLI tools
- Build command hierarchies and maintain proper relationships
- Handle various help text formats and patterns
- Generate structured output for use in test generation
- Process complex command hierarchies using two-phase analysis and cycle detection
- Provide detailed progress reporting through verbose logging
- Fall back to LLM-based analysis for challenging CLI formats

The analyzer provides a solid foundation for the test plan generator we're now building.

## Current Technical Challenges

1. **Test Plan Structure**: Designing a flexible yet structured model for test plans
2. **Test Case Generation**: Using LLMs to generate meaningful test cases for different command types
3. **Expected Output Prediction**: Accurately predicting command outputs in various scenarios
4. **Coverage Optimization**: Ensuring generated test plans achieve good coverage of CLI functionality

## Current Component Development

We are developing the following components:

1. **TestPlan Model**: Data structure to represent comprehensive test plans
2. **TestCase Model**: Representation of individual test cases with expected outcomes
3. **TestGenerator Interface**: Abstract definition of test generation capabilities
4. **StandardTestGenerator**: Concrete implementation using LLM services
5. **CLI Integration**: Command-line interface for test plan generation

## Implementation Progress

- Core architecture is fully implemented
- CLI analyzer is complete and working well with robust handling of complex command structures
- LLM service integration is in place with multiple provider support
- Beginning work on test plan generation models and interfaces
- Starting implementation of LLM-based test case generation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Define the TestPlan and TestCase data models
2. Implement the TestGenerator interface
3. Create the StandardTestGenerator class
4. Design effective LLM prompts for test generation
5. Integrate with the CLI framework for end-user access

## Development Context

The project is using a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns. We're focusing on maintainable, testable code with high coverage and clear documentation.

### Current Status

- Phase 000 (Project Setup) is complete
- Phase 001 (Testing Infrastructure) is complete

## Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Decisions
1. **Python Version**: Using Python 3.13 for latest features and performance
2. **Package Management**: Using uv for speed and reliability
3. **CLI Framework**: Using Typer for type-safe CLI development
4. **ORM**: Using SQLModel for database interactions
5. **Logging**: Using structlog for structured logging
6. **Testing**: Using pytest with pytest-cov for coverage

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Components with well-defined interfaces
2. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
3. **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
4. **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible implementations
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
6. **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains

### Resolved Decisions
1. **Package Management**: Chosen uv over pip/poetry for speed and reliability
2. **Code Formatting**: Chosen ruff over black for linting and formatting
3. **Test Framework**: Chosen pytest over unittest for flexibility and plugins
4. **CI/CD Provider**: Chosen GitHub Actions for tight integration with repository
5. **CLI Analysis Approach**: Implemented two-phase analysis with cycle detection for robust processing

### Pending Decisions
1. **Default LLM Provider**: Evaluating OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. local models
2. **Container Management**: Evaluating different Docker Python libraries
