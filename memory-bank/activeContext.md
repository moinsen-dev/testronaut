# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project has completed the initial setup phase (Phase 000) and is now in the Testing Infrastructure phase (Phase 001). This phase involves establishing a comprehensive testing framework for the project, including:

1. Completing the unit testing framework
2. Implementing integration testing
3. Setting up functional testing
4. Enhancing test coverage and reporting

## Recent Activities
1. Completed project directory structure following domain-driven design
2. Implemented modular CLI interface with Typer
3. Set up dependency management with UV
4. Created development environment with pre-commit hooks
5. Implemented initial unit tests with 48% code coverage
6. Added comprehensive documentation for developers

## Current Tasks
1. Unit Testing Framework
   - [x] Set up pytest configuration
   - [x] Create basic test fixtures
   - [x] Implement initial unit tests for CLI
   - [x] Implement initial unit tests for analyzer
   - [ ] Complete comprehensive unit tests for all modules
   - [ ] Create mock objects for external dependencies
   - [ ] Achieve at least 80% code coverage

2. Integration Testing Framework
   - [ ] Set up integration test structure
   - [ ] Create database test fixtures
   - [ ] Implement component interaction tests
   - [ ] Create mock LLM service for testing

3. Functional Testing Framework
   - [ ] Design workflow-based testing approach
   - [ ] Create end-to-end test scenarios
   - [ ] Implement CLI interaction testing
   - [ ] Set up Docker test environment

4. Coverage and Reporting
   - [x] Configure basic coverage reporting
   - [ ] Enhance coverage measurement
   - [ ] Set up report generation in different formats
   - [ ] Create coverage enforcement rules

## Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Decisions
1. **Python Version**: Using Python 3.13 for latest features and performance
2. **Package Management**: Using uv for speed and reliability
3. **CLI Framework**: Using Typer for type-safe CLI development
4. **Testing Framework**: Using pytest with pytest-cov for coverage
5. **Code Quality**: Using ruff for linting and formatting
6. **Static Type Checking**: Using mypy for type checking

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Components with well-defined interfaces
2. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
3. **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
4. **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible implementations
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
6. **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains

### Resolved Decisions
1. **Package Management**: Chosen uv over pip/poetry for speed and reliability
2. **Code Formatting**: Chosen ruff over black for linting and formatting
3. **Test Framework**: Chosen pytest over unittest for flexibility and plugins

### Pending Decisions
1. **CI/CD Provider**: Evaluating GitHub Actions vs. alternatives
2. **Documentation Generator**: Considering MkDocs vs. Sphinx
3. **Default LLM Provider**: Evaluating OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. local models

## Blockers & Challenges
1. **Docker Integration**: Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
2. **LLM Cost Management**: Optimizing LLM usage to control costs
3. **Testing Approach**: Designing tests for AI-based systems
4. **Mocking LLM Responses**: Creating realistic test fixtures for LLM

## Next Steps
After completing Phase 001, the project will move to Phase 002: CI/CD Pipeline. The immediate next steps after current tasks are:

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
2. Configure automated testing on push and pull requests
3. Set up release automation
4. Implement code quality checks in CI pipeline

## Active Discussions
1. Best practices for testing LLM interactions
2. Strategies for mocking Docker containers in tests
3. Approaches for semantic comparison in test verification
4. Performance optimization for LLM-based tests
