## Current Focus

We are now beginning Phase 003: Core Architecture. After successfully completing Phase 002 (CI/CD Pipeline), our focus shifts to building the core architectural foundation of the Testronaut application. This phase involves implementing the data models, component interfaces, error handling framework, and logging systems that will support all subsequent features.

### Key Tasks for Phase 003

1. Database Models and Migrations
   - Design SQLModel-based data models for all entities (CLI tools, commands, test plans, test cases, results)
   - Implement relationships between models as defined in the data model diagram
   - Create database connection and session management
   - Set up Alembic for database migrations
   - Implement initial migration script

2. Component Interfaces
   - Define interface protocols for all core components:
     - CLI Analyzer
     - Test Generator
     - Test Executor
     - Result Verifier
     - Report Generator
   - Implement base classes for common functionality
   - Create factory classes for component instantiation
   - Set up dependency injection framework
   - Document interface contracts

3. Error Handling Framework
   - Design custom exception hierarchy
   - Implement global error handlers
   - Create error logging and reporting utilities
   - Set up error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement user-friendly error messages

4. Logging and Monitoring
   - Configure structured logging system
   - Implement context-aware logging
   - Create performance monitoring utilities
   - Set up health check endpoints
   - Implement telemetry collection

### Implementation Approach

We will follow a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Data Models**: Using SQLModel to create ORM models that reflect our domain entities
2. **Component Interfaces**: Creating protocol-based interfaces to define component contracts
3. **Error Handling**: Building a comprehensive exception hierarchy for different error types
4. **Logging Framework**: Implementing structured logging with contextual information

We'll use a test-driven development approach, creating tests for models, interfaces, and utilities before implementing the actual code. This will ensure that our architecture meets the requirements and is robust.

### Recent Decisions

- We've successfully completed Phase 002 (CI/CD Pipeline) with all workflows implemented and tested
- We're using GitHub Actions with the latest tooling (actions/checkout@v4.2.2, actions/setup-python@v5)
- We're standardizing on Python 3.13 for build and documentation jobs
- We've implemented comprehensive security scanning with Safety, Bandit, and CodeQL
- We've updated our documentation to reflect the current project status

### Architectural Decisions for Phase 003

1. **Database Technology**: Using SQLite with SQLModel for simplicity and ease of deployment
2. **Interface Design**: Using Python's Protocol classes for type-safe interface definitions
3. **Error Handling**: Creating a custom exception hierarchy with specialized error types
4. **Logging System**: Implementing structured logging with JSON output format
5. **Component Communication**: Using a dependency injection approach for loose coupling

### Next Steps

1. Start with implementing the data models and database setup
2. Define interface protocols for core components
3. Create base classes for common functionality
4. Set up the error handling framework
5. Implement the logging system

## Development Context

The project is using a domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns. We're focusing on maintainable, testable code with high coverage and clear documentation.

### Current Status

5. **Logging**: Using structlog for structured logging
6. **Testing**: Using pytest with pytest-cov for coverage

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Components with well-defined interfaces
2. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
3. **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
4. **Strategy Pattern**: For flexible implementations
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
6. **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizing code around business domains

### Resolved Decisions
1. **Package Management**: Chosen uv over pip/poetry for speed and reliability
2. **Code Formatting**: Chosen ruff over black for linting and formatting
3. **Test Framework**: Chosen pytest over unittest for flexibility and plugins
4. **CI/CD Provider**: Chosen GitHub Actions for tight integration with repository

### Pending Decisions
1. **Default LLM Provider**: Evaluating OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. local models
