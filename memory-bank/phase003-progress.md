### In Progress Tasks

1. ðŸ”„ Create concrete implementations of key interfaces:
   - âœ“ Analyzer implementation using Docker and LLM services
   - Test Generator implementation using LLM services
   - Test Executor implementation using Docker environments
   - Result Verifier implementation

### Upcoming Tasks

1. ðŸ“‹ Implement SQLite database integration
2. ðŸ“‹ Create repository implementations for models
3. ðŸ“‹ Develop command-line interface commands
4. ðŸ“‹ Implement workflow orchestration
5. ðŸ“‹ Write unit and integration tests
6. ðŸ“‹ Create documentation

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on integrating the Docker utilities and LLM services with concrete implementations of the core interfaces. We've successfully implemented and verified the following components:

1. **Configuration Management**: We can initialize and view configuration settings via CLI commands and programmatically.
2. **Docker Integration**: We can pull images, create containers, run commands, and manage Docker environments.
3. **LLM Services**: We have a robust provider-based architecture with implementations for Mock, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
4. **CLI Framework**: We have a command structure ready for implementation of analyze, execute, and verify commands.
5. **Analyzer Implementation**: We have two analyzer implementations:
   - Standard analyzer that uses regex patterns to extract commands, options, and arguments
   - LLM-enhanced analyzer that improves analysis quality using LLM capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Create test generator implementation with concrete LLM integration
2. Finalize test executor implementation using the Docker environment utilities
3. Implement result verification using deterministic checks and LLM-assisted validation

## Implementation Details

### CLI Analyzer Implementation

The CLI analyzer module provides two main implementations:

1. `StandardCLIAnalyzer`: Uses regex patterns and command execution to extract information from CLI tools
   - Extracts commands, options, and arguments from help text
   - Parses examples from documentation
   - Identifies version information
   - Creates structured models of CLI tools
   - Saves analysis results as JSON

2. `LLMEnhancedAnalyzer`: Enhances the standard analyzer with LLM capabilities to:
   - Generate better descriptions for commands and options
   - Extract examples when not clearly defined in the help text
   - Improve command discovery for complex CLI tools
   - Create more accurate documentation

The analyzer workflow is as follows:
1. Verify tool installation and accessibility
2. Extract help text and version information
3. Parse commands, options, and arguments
4. Enrich information using LLM (if deep analysis is enabled)
5. Save structured data to JSON for later use

### Docker Integration

The Docker integration module (`src/testronaut/utils/docker.py`) provides two main classes:

1. `DockerClient`: A wrapper around Docker CLI commands for managing containers, networks, volumes, and image operations.
2. `DockerTestEnvironment`: A higher-level utility for managing test environments with isolated workspaces, network configurations, and test execution.

### LLM Service Integration

The LLM service integration (`src/testronaut/utils/llm/`) provides:

1. `LLMService`: A high-level service for generating text and structured JSON from LLM providers.
2. `LLMProvider` protocol: Defines the interface that all providers must implement.
3. Provider implementations:
   - `MockProvider`: For testing without requiring external API access
   - `OpenAIProvider`: For integrating with OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
   - `AnthropicProvider`: For integrating with Anthropic Claude models

### CLI Structure

The CLI module structure is designed with subcommands for:

1. `config`: Configuration management commands (implemented and working)
2. `analyze`: CLI tool analysis commands (implemented with standard and LLM-enhanced modes)
3. `execute`: Test execution commands (placeholder implementation)
4. `verify`: Result verification commands (placeholder implementation)

### Installation and Usage

To use the project, you need to:

1. Create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
2. Activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the package: `uv pip install -e .`
4. Initialize configuration: `testronaut config init`

The CLI provides help and documentation via the `--help` flag.
