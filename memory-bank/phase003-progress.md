## Implementation Details

### LLM Service Integration

The LLM service integration (`src/testronaut/utils/llm/`) provides:

1. `LLMService`: A high-level service for generating text and structured JSON from LLM providers.
2. `LLMProvider` protocol: Defines the interface that all providers must implement.
3. Provider implementations:
   - `MockProvider`: For testing without requiring external API access
   - `OpenAIProvider`: For integrating with OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
   - `AnthropicProvider`: For integrating with Anthropic Claude models

The service now includes:
- Task-specific model selection (chat, json, embedding)
- Provider-specific configuration (API keys, organization IDs, base URLs)
- Environment variable support for API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, TESTRONAUT_LLM_API_KEY)
- Improved model selection based on the task being performed

Configuration is managed through:
- Default settings in `src/testronaut/config/default_config.yaml`
- User settings in `~/.testronaut/config.yaml`
- Environment variables

### CLI Analyzer Implementation

The CLI analyzer module provides two main implementations:

1. `StandardCLIAnalyzer`: Uses regex patterns and command execution to extract information from CLI tools
   - Extracts commands, options, and arguments from help text
   - Parses examples from documentation
   - Identifies version information
   - Creates structured models of CLI tools
   - Saves analysis results as JSON

2. `LLMEnhancedAnalyzer`: Enhances the standard analyzer with LLM capabilities to:
   - Generate better descriptions for commands and options
   - Extract examples when not clearly defined in the help text
   - Improve command discovery for complex CLI tools
   - Create more accurate documentation

The analyzer workflow is as follows:
1. Verify tool installation and accessibility
2. Extract help text and version information
3. Parse commands, options, and arguments
4. Enrich information using LLM (if deep analysis is enabled)
5. Save structured data to JSON for later use

### Docker Integration

The Docker integration module (`src/testronaut/utils/docker.py`) provides two main classes:

1. `DockerClient`: A wrapper around Docker CLI commands for managing containers, networks, volumes, and image operations.
2. `DockerTestEnvironment`: A higher-level utility for managing test environments with isolated workspaces, network configurations, and test execution.

### CLI Structure

The CLI module structure is designed with subcommands for:

1. `config`: Configuration management commands (implemented and working)
2. `analyze`: CLI tool analysis commands (implemented with standard and LLM-enhanced modes)
3. `execute`: Test execution commands (placeholder implementation)
4. `verify`: Result verification commands (placeholder implementation)

### Installation and Usage

To use the project, you need to:

1. Create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
2. Activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the package: `uv pip install -e .`
4. Initialize configuration: `testronaut config init`

The CLI provides help and documentation via the `--help` flag.
