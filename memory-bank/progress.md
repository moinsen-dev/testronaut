## Roadmap

The implementation plan follows a sequential approach with some parallel development where possible:

### Infrastructure Phases (Weeks 1-2)
- **Phase 000: Project Setup** - Setting the foundation
- **Phase 001: Testing Infrastructure** - Ensuring code quality
- **Phase 002: CI/CD Pipeline** - Automating workflows
- **Phase 003: Core Architecture** - Implementing base components

### Feature Phases (Weeks 3-7)
- **Phase 004: CLI Analysis Engine** - Understanding CLI tools (2 weeks)
- **Phase 005: Test Plan Generator** - Creating test plans (2 weeks)
- **Phase 006: Docker Test Execution** - Running tests in containers (1 week)
- **Phase 007: AI Result Verification** - Verifying test results (2 weeks)

### Integration Phases (Weeks 8-10)
- **Phase 008: Model Flexibility** - Supporting multiple LLMs (1 week)
- **Phase 009: Reporting System** - Generating reports (1 week)
- **Phase 010: Integration & Release** - Final MVP release (1 week)

## Known Issues & Limitations

The project is in very early development, and most functionality is not yet implemented. Current limitations include:

1. No functional CLI tool yet
2. No integration with Docker or LLMs
3. Testing infrastructure not established
4. CI/CD pipeline not configured

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete Phase 000** (Project Setup)
   - Estimated completion: 1 week
   - Remaining tasks: Directory structure, configuration, CLI skeleton

2. **Phase 001** (Testing Infrastructure)
   - Estimated start: After Phase 000 completion
   - Estimated duration: 1 week
   - Key deliverables: Unit tests, integration tests, CI configuration

## Technical Debt

As the project is just starting, there is minimal technical debt. However, we're tracking the following items to address:

1. Need to establish coding standards and enforce through linting
2. Need to create comprehensive test strategy
3. Need to determine logging and monitoring approach
