## Known Issues & Limitations

The project has made significant progress with setup, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD, but still has the following limitations:

1. Core architecture not yet implemented
2. CLI interface not yet connected to actual functionality
3. Integration with Docker or LLMs not implemented
4. Test coverage needs improvement in CLI command modules
5. Analyzer has limited support for complex command structures

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete Phase 003** (Core Architecture)
   - Estimated completion: 2 weeks
   - Key deliverables: Database models, component interfaces, error handling, logging

2. **Phase 004** (CLI Analysis Engine)
   - Estimated start: After Phase 003 completion
   - Estimated duration: 2 weeks
   - Key deliverables: CLI tool analysis, command extraction, help text parsing

## Technical Debt

Current technical debt items to address:

1. ‚úÖ Coding standards established, enforced through pre-commit hooks
2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive test strategy implemented
3. ‚úÖ CLI command tests fixed with simpler approach
4. ‚úÖ Analyzer improved for better subcommand detection
5. ‚úÖ Collection warnings for test classes with constructors addressed
6. ‚ùå Error handling implementation needed

## Prioritization

Current priority is to implement the core architecture, focusing first on the data models and database infrastructure, followed by component interfaces, error handling, and logging.

## Decisions

- ‚úÖ Rename TestCase, TestPlan and TestGenerator classes to avoid pytest collection warnings
- ‚úÖ Use a mock CLI implementation for functional tests to avoid dependency issues
- ‚úÖ Use SQLModel for ORM with SQLite backend
- ‚úÖ Implement Protocol-based interfaces for component contracts
