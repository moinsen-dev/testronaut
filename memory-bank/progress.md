## Known Issues & Limitations

The project has made significant progress with setup and testing infrastructure, but still has the following limitations:

1. CLI interface is not yet connected to actual functionality
2. Integration with Docker or LLMs not implemented
3. Test coverage needs improvement in CLI command modules
4. No CI/CD pipeline configured
5. Analyzer has limited support for complex command structures
6. Collection warnings for test classes need to be addressed

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete Phase 001** (Testing Infrastructure)
   - Estimated completion: 1 week
   - Key deliverables: Comprehensive testing framework, 80%+ coverage, functional tests

2. **Phase 002** (CI/CD Pipeline)
   - Estimated start: After Phase 001 completion
   - Estimated duration: 1 week
   - Key deliverables: GitHub Actions workflow, automated testing, release pipeline

## Technical Debt

Current technical debt items to address:

1. ✅ Coding standards established, enforced through pre-commit hooks
2. ✅ Comprehensive test strategy implemented
3. ✅ CLI command tests fixed with simpler approach
4. ✅ Analyzer improved for better subcommand detection
5. 🚧 Collection warnings for test classes with constructors
6. ❌ Error handling implementation needed

## Prioritization

Current priority is to complete Phase 001 by addressing the remaining test coverage issues, particularly in the CLI commands module, and then proceed to Phase 002.

## Decisions

- ✅ Rename TestCase, TestPlan and TestGenerator classes to avoid pytest collection warnings
- ✅ Use a mock CLI implementation for functional tests to avoid dependency issues

## Overall Progress

- **Total phases completed**: 0.95/2 (47.5%)
- **Current coverage**: 72%
- **Current phase**: Phase 001 (Testing Infrastructure)
