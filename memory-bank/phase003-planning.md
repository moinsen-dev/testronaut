# Phase 003: Core Architecture Planning

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing the core architecture of the Testronaut project. Phase 003 focuses on establishing the fundamental architectural components that will support all subsequent features, including data models, component interfaces, error handling, and logging.

## Architectural Components

### 1. Data Models and Database Infrastructure

The data model is based on the entity-relationship diagram in `diagrams/data-model.md`, which defines the following key entities:

- **CLITool**: Represents the command-line tool being tested
- **Command**: Individual commands provided by the CLI tool
- **Option**: Command-line options for commands
- **Argument**: Positional arguments for commands
- **Example**: Example usages with expected outputs
- **TestPlan**: Collection of test cases for a CLI tool
- **TestCase**: Individual test scenario
- **Dependency**: Relationship between test cases
- **TestResult**: Actual outputs and comparison results
- **TestReport**: Summary of test execution results

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Base Models (Week 1, Day 1-2)**
   - Create `models/base.py` with SQLModel base classes
   - Implement common fields and utility methods
   - Set up database configuration and session management

2. **CLI Tool Models (Week 1, Day 3-4)**
   - Implement `models/cli_tool.py` with CLI tool and command models
   - Define relationships between CLI tools and commands
   - Establish command option and argument models

3. **Test Models (Week 1, Day 5)**
   - Create `models/test_plan.py` for test plans and cases
   - Implement `models/test_result.py` for test execution results
   - Define `models/test_report.py` for reporting

4. **Database Migrations (Week 2, Day 1)**
   - Set up Alembic for migration management
   - Create initial migration script
   - Implement database versioning

### 2. Component Interfaces

Based on the architecture diagram in `diagrams/architecture.md`, we will define interfaces for five core components:

- **CLI Analyzer**: Parses and understands CLI tools
- **Test Generator**: Creates test plans
- **Test Executor**: Runs tests in Docker containers
- **Result Verifier**: Compares expected vs. actual results
- **LLM Manager**: Handles AI model interactions

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Interface Base (Week 2, Day 2)**
   - Create `interfaces/base.py` with common interface patterns
   - Implement factory base classes
   - Set up dependency injection framework

2. **Core Component Interfaces (Week 2, Day 3-4)**
   - Define `interfaces/analyzer.py` for CLI analysis
   - Create `interfaces/generator.py` for test generation
   - Implement `interfaces/executor.py` for test execution
   - Define `interfaces/verifier.py` for result verification
   - Create `interfaces/reporter.py` for report generation

3. **Factory Classes (Week 2, Day 5)**
   - Implement factory classes for component instantiation
   - Set up dependency registration system
   - Create configuration-based factory initialization

### 3. Error Handling Framework

A comprehensive error handling system to manage exceptions consistently:

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Exception Hierarchy (Week 3, Day 1-2)**
   - Create `utils/errors.py` with base exception classes
   - Define specialized exceptions for different error types:
     - ConfigurationError
     - ValidationError
     - ExecutionError
     - VerificationError
     - ConnectivityError

2. **Error Handlers (Week 3, Day 3)**
   - Implement global error handling mechanism
   - Create user-friendly error message formatting
   - Set up error recovery strategies

### 4. Logging and Monitoring

A structured logging system for comprehensive application monitoring:

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Logging Infrastructure (Week 3, Day 4)**
   - Create `utils/logging.py` with logging configuration
   - Implement context-aware logging with request IDs
   - Set up structured JSON logging format

2. **Monitoring System (Week 3, Day 5)**
   - Implement `utils/monitoring.py` with performance metrics
   - Create health check endpoints
   - Set up telemetry collection

## Testing Strategy

We will follow a test-driven development approach:

1. **Model Tests**
   - Test database model creation and validation
   - Verify relationship navigation
   - Test serialization and deserialization
   - Confirm migration integrity

2. **Interface Tests**
   - Test interface contract compliance
   - Verify factory class functionality
   - Test dependency injection
   - Confirm proper component initialization

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test exception handling
   - Verify recovery mechanisms
   - Confirm error reporting

4. **Logging Tests**
   - Test log generation
   - Verify contextual information
   - Confirm log formatting

- Day 4: Logging infrastructure
- Day 5: Monitoring system

### Week 4: Integration and Testing
- Day 1-2: Integration testing
- Day 3-4: Documentation and examples
- Day 5: Review and finalization

## Success Criteria

Phase 003 will be considered complete when:

1. All data models are implemented and tested
2. Database migrations are working
3. Component interfaces are defined and documented
4. Factory classes and dependency injection are implemented
5. Error handling framework is operational
6. Logging and monitoring systems are configured
7. All tests are passing with good coverage
8. Documentation is complete

## Technical Considerations

1. **SQLModel Integration**: Ensure proper integration with Pydantic v2
2. **Database Connection Pooling**: Implement efficient connection management
3. **Interface Design**: Use Python Protocols for type-safe interfaces
4. **Dependency Injection**: Consider a lightweight approach suitable for Python
5. **Error Propagation**: Design clear error propagation strategies
6. **Logging Performance**: Ensure logging doesn't impact performance significantly

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 003, we will:

1. Review the architecture with the team
2. Update documentation to reflect implementation details
3. Proceed to Phase 004 (CLI Analysis Engine)
4. Begin implementing concrete components based on the interfaces
