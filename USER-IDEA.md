# AI-Assisted End-to-End CLI Test Suite

## 0. Goals, Context, and Motivation
Modern command-line interfaces (CLIs) offer powerful workflows, but testing them remains largely manual, error-prone, and hard to scale. This project introduces an AI-driven framework for end-to-end testing of CLI tools, with a strong focus on dynamic command analysis, intelligent output verification, and fully automated test plan generation.

The vision is to replace static, hand-written test scripts with a system where large language models (LLMs) interpret CLI semantics, simulate user interactions, and automatically generate, execute, and verify test cases. This enables scalable and robust validation of CLI tools without requiring deep manual involvement.

## 1. Overview
This specification defines a novel approach for testing CLI tools through intelligent, AI-assisted, end-to-end test suites. It emphasizes automation and semantic understanding over traditional, brittle string-matching methods. The system is designed to:
- Simulate realistic command-line workflows
- Automatically analyze CLI commands
- Generate test plans and expected outputs
- Verify results using LLM-based semantic comparison
- Run all executions in isolated containers for security and consistency

## 2. Key Functionalities

### 2.1 AI-Based Command Analysis and Plan Generation *(Core Entry Point)*
- A planning tool powered by an LLM serves as the primary interface for initiating tests.
- Developers input a CLI command, partial command, or help reference.
- The system automatically:
  - Analyzes command syntax and intent
  - Retrieves relevant help or documentation output
  - Generates a comprehensive plan of testable commands
  - Identifies dependencies and sequences (e.g., "create" followed by "update")
- This planner is the heart of the testing system and eliminates the need for manual scripting.

### 2.2 Command Execution & Expected Result Generation
- Based on the generated plan, the system executes CLI commands in a sandboxed, containerized environment.
- A dedicated mode (e.g., `--generate-expected`) marks the outputs as canonical references.
- Captured expected results include:
  - CLI stdout/stderr
  - Modified or created files
  - Metadata (e.g., timestamps, IDs, state transitions)

### 2.3 Intelligent Result Verification
- A `check` mode re-executes the plan and compares outputs to the expected results.
- LLMs perform semantic evaluation to handle:
  - Variations in formatting or order
  - Structured data differences (e.g., JSON)
  - Dynamic placeholders (e.g., UUIDs, timestamps)

### 2.4 Command Sequence Support
- The system supports multi-step CLI flows involving shared context.
- The AI planner tracks references (e.g., created IDs) and reuses them in follow-up commands.
- Example:
  - `tool create-project --name "New Project"` â†’ returns project ID
  - `tool add-task --project-id <ID> --desc "First Task"`
- The framework dynamically manages and injects these values.

## 3. Tool Stack
- **CLI Core:** Python CLI application using the `rich` package for interactive output and enhanced formatting.
- **Storage:** SQLite database for managing test plans, metadata, and results.
- **AI Orchestration:**
  - LangChain to coordinate LLM interactions
  - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini models
  - Local LLM support for private or offline scenarios
- **Isolation:**
  - All test executions run inside Docker containers to ensure a controlled, reproducible, and safe environment.
  - Containers are disposable and sandboxed, preventing unintended system modifications or conflicts.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Minimize reliance on external test runners.
- Treat the CLI tool as a black box; no invasive changes required.
- Ensure all artifacts are stored in a reproducible, structured format for traceability.
- Enforce containerized execution to guarantee test isolation.

## 5. Integration and Architecture Guidelines
- Start by analyzing the CLI tool's help output, command parser, and autocomplete mechanisms.
- Implement the AI planner and test executor as a parallel module.
- Use Docker-based containers for running tests, maintaining reproducibility and safety.
- Prioritize modular, developer-friendly integration with minimal overhead.

## 6. Edge Cases and Considerations
- Handle non-deterministic output via placeholder detection.
- Normalize cross-environment differences (e.g., file paths, encodings).
- Include robustness tests for invalid inputs, user errors, and failure conditions.
- Leverage Docker for environmental consistency across different OS and dev setups.

## 7. Phased Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1:** Build the AI-based command planner and help parser.
- **Phase 2:** Implement command execution with `--generate-expected` mode in Docker containers.
- **Phase 3:** Develop the semantic diff engine for LLM-based output comparison.
- **Phase 4:** Add support for variable tracking across command sequences.
- **Phase 5:** Validate the system on real-world CLI tools and iterate based on findings.
