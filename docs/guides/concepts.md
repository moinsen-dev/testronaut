# Core Concepts

This guide explains the core concepts behind Testronaut and how they work together to generate and execute tests for command-line applications.

## Overview

Testronaut is an AI-assisted testing tool designed to automate the testing of command-line applications. It reduces the need for manual test case creation by analyzing the structure of CLI applications and generating comprehensive test plans.

## Key Components

### CLI Analyzer

The CLI Analyzer examines command-line applications to understand:

- Available commands and subcommands
- Command options and arguments
- Help text and usage patterns
- Command relationships and hierarchies

The analyzer uses this information to build a detailed model of the CLI application that serves as input for the test generator.

### Test Plan Generator

The Test Plan Generator creates structured test plans based on the CLI analyzer's output. A test plan consists of:

- **Test Cases**: Individual scenarios to test specific commands and options
- **Test Steps**: Detailed steps within each test case
- **Expected Results**: What success looks like for each test

The generator uses AI to identify meaningful test scenarios, edge cases, and command combinations.

### Test Executor

The Test Executor runs the generated test plans against the target CLI application. It:

- Executes commands in isolated environments (using Docker)
- Captures command output and exit codes
- Compares actual results with expected results
- Records test outcomes and evidence

### Result Verifier

The Result Verifier analyzes test execution results to determine test success or failure. It uses AI to:

- Interpret command output semantically
- Identify meaningful failures vs. superficial differences
- Provide detailed explanations for failed tests
- Suggest improvements for test plans

## Key Concepts

### Test Plans

A `TPTestPlan` is the central structure in Testronaut. It contains:

- Metadata about the test target
- A collection of test cases
- Configuration for test execution

### Test Cases

A `TPTestCase` represents a single test scenario. It contains:

- A descriptive name and purpose
- Test steps to execute
- Expected results
- Status information

### Command Analysis

Command analysis creates a structured representation of:

- Command hierarchy
- Command options and arguments
- Expected behavior and output

### AI Integration

Testronaut integrates with LLMs to:

- Generate meaningful test cases
- Verify test results semantically
- Improve test plans over time

## Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Testronaut analyzes the structure of a CLI application
2. **Generate**: AI creates a comprehensive test plan
3. **Execute**: Tests run in isolated environments
4. **Verify**: Results are semantically analyzed
5. **Report**: Detailed reports are generated
