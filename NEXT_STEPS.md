# Next Steps for Testronaut

## Current Status
âœ… **Phase 000: Project Setup** - Completed
ðŸš§ **Phase 001: Testing Infrastructure** - In Progress (20%)

## Phase 001 Tasks

### 1. Unit Testing Framework (40% Complete)
- [x] Set up pytest configuration
- [x] Create basic test fixtures
- [x] Implement initial tests for CLI
- [x] Implement initial tests for analyzer
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for all modules

  - [ ] Test model serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Create mocks for external dependencies
  - [ ] Mock LLM services
  - [ ] Mock Docker interactions
  - [ ] Mock filesystem operations
- [ ] Implement test helper utilities
- [ ] Add negative test cases

### 2. Integration Testing Framework (0% Complete)

- [ ] Set up Docker test environment
  - [ ] Create test container setup/teardown
  - [ ] Implement isolated test environments

### 4. Coverage and Reporting (20% Complete)
- [x] Configure basic coverage reporting
- [ ] Enhance coverage measurement
  - [ ] Set coverage thresholds
  - [ ] Configure branch coverage
- [ ] Set up report generation in different formats
  - [ ] HTML reports
  - [ ] XML reports for CI integration
  - [ ] Badge generation
- [ ] Create coverage enforcement rules

## Test-Driven Development Guidelines
1. Write tests before implementing features
2. Keep test coverage above 80%
3. Create both positive and negative test cases
4. Test edge cases and error conditions
5. Use descriptive test names in the format `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected_result>`

## Next Phase Preview (Phase 002: CI/CD Pipeline)
After completing Phase 001, we'll move to setting up continuous integration and deployment:

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
2. Configure automated testing
3. Implement code quality checks
4. Set up automated releases
5. Create deployment documentation
