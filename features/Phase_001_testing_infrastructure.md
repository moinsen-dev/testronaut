# Phase 001: Testing Infrastructure

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Unit Testing Framework | ❌ Not Started |
| Integration Testing Framework | ❌ Not Started |
| Functional Testing Framework | ❌ Not Started |
| Test Coverage and Reporting | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
The Testronaut project aims to provide robust testing for CLI tools. To ensure the quality and reliability of our own application, we need a comprehensive testing infrastructure from the beginning. This phase establishes the testing foundation that will be used throughout the project lifecycle. Since we are building a testing tool, our own testing practices must be exemplary.

## Goal
Create a comprehensive testing infrastructure that supports test-driven development across all phases of the project. This includes unit, integration, and functional testing frameworks, as well as tools for measuring test coverage and generating reports.

## Architecture
The testing infrastructure will be organized into separate components for different testing needs:

```
tests/
├── unit/               # Unit tests for isolated components
│   ├── cli/            # Tests for CLI interface
│   ├── core/           # Tests for core business logic
│   └── utils/          # Tests for utility functions
├── integration/        # Integration tests between components
│   ├── analyzer_llm/   # Tests for analyzer-LLM integration
│   ├── generator_db/   # Tests for generator-database integration
│   └── executor_docker/ # Tests for executor-Docker integration
├── functional/         # End-to-end functional tests
│   ├── scenarios/      # Real-world testing scenarios
│   └── workflows/      # Complete workflows
├── fixtures/           # Test fixtures and test data
├── mocks/              # Mock objects and services
└── conftest.py         # pytest configuration
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Unit Testing Framework
1. Configure pytest as the primary test runner
2. Implement test discovery and organization
3. Create base test classes for common test patterns
4. Set up test fixtures for common dependencies
5. Implement mocking framework for external dependencies

### 2. Integration Testing Framework
1. Create test infrastructure for component interactions
2. Implement integration test fixtures
3. Set up database testing with test isolation
4. Configure Docker testing environment
5. Implement LLM service mocks for testing

### 3. Functional Testing Framework
1. Design workflow-based testing approach
2. Create test fixtures for end-to-end scenarios
3. Implement helper functions for scenario setup and verification
4. Set up test isolation for parallel execution
5. Create CLI interaction testing tools

### 4. Test Coverage and Reporting
1. Configure coverage measurement with pytest-cov
2. Set up report generation for different formats
3. Integrate coverage reporting with CI/CD
4. Implement test result visualization
5. Create coverage enforcement rules

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for containerized testing
- SQLite for database testing
- Mock LLM services for AI testing

## Related Features
This phase provides testing support for:
- All subsequent phases (002-010)
- Continuous integration in Phase 002
- Quality assurance throughout development

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Unit Testing Framework Tests**
   - Test that test discovery works correctly
   - Test that fixture management works
   - Test that mocking functions properly
   - Test that assertion utilities work as expected

2. **Integration Testing Framework Tests**
   - Test component interaction isolation
   - Test database test isolation
   - Test Docker environment setup/teardown
   - Test LLM service mocking

3. **Functional Testing Framework Tests**
   - Test workflow execution
   - Test scenario setup and teardown
   - Test CLI interaction utilities
   - Test result verification

4. **Coverage and Reporting Tests**
   - Test coverage calculation accuracy
   - Test report generation in different formats
   - Test coverage enforcement rules
   - Test integration with CI/CD

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Start by implementing the unit testing framework
2. Use TDD for implementing testing utilities
3. Create documentation for testing patterns
4. Ensure all testing utilities have their own tests
5. Use realistic examples from project requirements

### Test Verification
1. Run meta-tests to verify testing infrastructure
2. Check that test isolation works correctly
3. Verify that coverage is accurately measured
4. Ensure reports are generated correctly

### Testing Iteration
1. Start with minimal implementations
2. Add features based on immediate testing needs
3. Refine as testing requirements evolve
4. Incorporate feedback from developers using the framework
