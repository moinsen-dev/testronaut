# Phase 005: Test Plan Generator

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Test Case Builder | ❌ Not Started |
| Edge Case Detection | ❌ Not Started |
| Test Plan Repository | ❌ Not Started |
| Test Plan Reviewer UI | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
After analyzing a CLI tool's structure and semantics, Testronaut needs to generate comprehensive test plans that cover various input combinations, edge cases, and error conditions. The Test Plan Generator leverages the CLI analysis results to create intelligent and thorough test cases that simulate real user interactions, providing much more comprehensive test coverage than manual test creation.

## Goal
Create an intelligent Test Plan Generator that builds comprehensive test plans based on CLI analysis, covering normal usage patterns, edge cases, error conditions, and command sequences. The generator should produce test cases that are both broad in coverage and precise in their expected outcomes.

## Architecture
The Test Plan Generator consists of the following components:

```
generator/
├── builder/
│   ├── test_case_builder.py     # Builds individual test cases
│   ├── sequence_builder.py      # Builds command sequences
│   └── plan_builder.py          # Assembles test plans
├── edge_case/
│   ├── boundary_detector.py     # Detects boundary conditions
│   ├── error_case_generator.py  # Generates error test cases
│   └── fuzzer.py                # Creates fuzzing test cases
├── repository/
│   ├── plan_repository.py       # Manages test plan storage
│   ├── case_repository.py       # Manages test case storage
│   └── plan_loader.py           # Loads and validates plans
└── ui/
    ├── plan_reviewer.py         # UI for reviewing plans
    └── plan_editor.py           # UI for editing plans
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Test Case Builder
1. Implement test case template generation

### 2. Edge Case Detection
1. Create boundary value analysis logic
2. Implement error condition detection
3. Develop fuzzing strategies
4. Build security test case generation
5. Implement performance edge case detection

### 3. Test Plan Repository
1. Design test plan data structure
2. Implement plan storage and retrieval
3. Create plan versioning system
4. Develop plan tagging and categorization
5. Build plan import/export functionality

### 4. Test Plan Reviewer UI
1. Design console-based plan review interface
2. Implement plan visualization
3. Create plan editing capabilities
4. Develop plan filtering and searching
5. Build plan approval workflow

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- CLI Analysis Engine for command metadata
- Database for storing test plans and cases
- LLM Manager for AI-assisted test case generation
- CLI Interface for user interaction

## Related Features
This phase provides inputs for:
- Phase 006: Docker Test Execution (uses generated test plans)
- Phase 009: Reporting System (test plan metadata)

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Test Case Builder Tests**
   - Test parameter combination generation
   - Test expected output prediction
   - Test command-line formatting
   - Test case validation

2. **Edge Case Detection Tests**
   - Test boundary value detection
   - Test error condition identification
   - Test fuzzing strategy effectiveness
   - Test security case generation

3. **Test Plan Repository Tests**
   - Test plan storage and retrieval
   - Test versioning functionality

   - Test approval workflow

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Use the CLI analysis data to guide test case generation
2. Leverage AI for generating realistic test cases
3. Implement comprehensive edge case detection
4. Create a flexible and usable review interface
5. Ensure plans are storable, versionable, and shareable

### Test Verification
1. Generate test plans for well-known CLI tools
2. Compare generated plans with manually created ones
3. Verify edge case coverage
4. Check plan storage and retrieval functionality

### Testing Iteration
1. Start with basic test case generation
2. Add edge case detection incrementally
3. Implement repository features
4. Develop review UI based on user feedback
5. Continuously improve test case quality through iterations
