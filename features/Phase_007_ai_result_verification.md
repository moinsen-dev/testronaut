# Phase 007: AI Result Verification

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Semantic Output Comparator | ❌ Not Started |
| Dynamic Content Handler | ❌ Not Started |
| Test Result Repository | ❌ Not Started |
| Verification Status Tracker | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
Traditional CLI testing relies on exact string matching, which is brittle and requires constant maintenance as outputs change. Testronaut uses AI-powered semantic comparison to verify command outputs, focusing on meaning rather than exact text. This approach is more robust, handles dynamic content like timestamps and UUIDs, and better simulates how humans evaluate command outputs.

## Goal
Create an AI-based verification system that can compare actual command outputs to expected results semantically, handle dynamic output elements, provide detailed comparison insights, and store verification results for reporting and analysis.

## Architecture
The AI Result Verification system consists of these components:

```
verifier/
├── comparator/
│   ├── semantic_comparator.py   # AI-based semantic comparison
│   ├── structural_comparator.py # Structure-aware comparison
│   └── exact_comparator.py      # Fallback exact comparison
├── dynamic/
│   ├── pattern_detector.py      # Detects dynamic content patterns
│   ├── normalizer.py            # Normalizes dynamic content
│   └── transformer.py           # Transforms outputs for comparison
├── repository/
│   ├── result_repository.py     # Stores verification results
│   ├── evidence_repository.py   # Stores comparison evidence
│   └── metadata_repository.py   # Stores verification metadata
└── status/
    ├── tracker.py               # Tracks verification status
    ├── analyzer.py              # Analyzes verification patterns
    └── reporter.py              # Reports verification results
```
