# Phase 008: Model Flexibility

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| LLM Integration Manager | ❌ Not Started |
| Cloud LLM Support | ❌ Not Started |
| Local LLM Support | ❌ Not Started |
| Model Configuration System | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
Testronaut relies on Large Language Models (LLMs) for several core functionalities, including CLI analysis, test plan generation, and result verification. To provide flexibility, cost efficiency, and support for different environments (including those with strict security requirements), the system needs to support both cloud-based and local LLMs with configurable options.

## Goal
Create a flexible LLM integration system that supports both cloud-based and local LLMs, provides optimization options for cost efficiency, and allows seamless switching between different models based on task requirements and user preferences.

## Architecture
The Model Flexibility system consists of these components:

```

├── manager/
│   ├── llm_manager.py       # Central LLM management
│   ├── provider_registry.py # Registry of available providers
│   └── task_router.py       # Routes tasks to appropriate models
├── cloud/
│   ├── openai_provider.py   # OpenAI API integration
│   ├── anthropic_provider.py # Anthropic API integration
│   └── azure_provider.py    # Azure OpenAI integration
├── local/
│   ├── local_provider.py    # Local model integration
│   ├── ollama_provider.py   # Ollama integration
│   └── model_downloader.py  # Downloads models for local use
└── config/
    ├── model_config.py      # Model configuration system
    ├── cost_optimizer.py    # Optimizes for cost efficiency
    └── token_counter.py     # Estimates token usage
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. LLM Integration Manager
1. Create unified LLM interface
2. Implement provider registry system
3. Develop task-specific routing logic
4. Build error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. Create logging and telemetry for LLM usage

### 2. Cloud LLM Support
1. Implement OpenAI API integration
2. Develop Anthropic Claude integration
3. Create Azure OpenAI support
4. Build authentication management
5. Implement rate limiting and error handling

### 3. Local LLM Support
1. Create integration with local model runners
2. Implement Ollama support
3. Develop model downloading and caching
4. Build resource management for local models
5. Create model verification and testing

### 4. Model Configuration System
1. Design configuration schema for LLM usage
2. Implement cost optimization strategies
3. Develop token usage estimation
4. Build configuration persistence
5. Create task-specific model selection

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- CLI Analysis Engine for command understanding
- Test Plan Generator for test case creation
- AI Result Verification for output comparison
- Configuration storage for user preferences

## Related Features
This phase supports:
- Phase 004: CLI Analysis Engine (uses LLMs)
- Phase 005: Test Plan Generator (uses LLMs)
- Phase 007: AI Result Verification (uses LLMs)

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **LLM Integration Manager Tests**
   - Test interface consistency across providers
   - Test provider registration and discovery
   - Test task routing logic
   - Test error handling and fallbacks

2. **Cloud LLM Support Tests**
   - Test API integrations for each provider
   - Test authentication and credential management
   - Test rate limiting and throttling
   - Test error handling for API issues

3. **Local LLM Support Tests**
   - Test local model execution
   - Test model downloading and caching
   - Test resource management
   - Test performance monitoring

4. **Model Configuration System Tests**
   - Test configuration loading and validation
   - Test cost optimization strategies
   - Test token usage estimation
   - Test task-specific model selection

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Create a consistent interface for all LLM providers
2. Optimize for cost efficiency by default
3. Implement robust error handling for all API calls
4. Support graceful fallbacks between providers
5. Ensure all sensitive credentials are properly secured

### Test Verification
1. Verify same prompts produce comparable results across providers
2. Check that token usage estimation is accurate
3. Ensure cost optimization strategies are effective
4. Verify that local models work correctly

### Testing Iteration
1. Start with a single cloud provider (OpenAI)
2. Add local model support
3. Implement additional cloud providers
4. Develop the model configuration system
5. Optimize based on real-world usage patterns
