# Testronaut Feature Overview

## Project Summary
Testronaut is an AI-powered, containerized framework for end-to-end testing of CLI tools. It analyzes commands, generates test plans, verifies outputs semantically with LLMs, and runs everything safely in Docker. The system aims to eliminate manual test script writing and maintenance while providing more robust test coverage that simulates real user interactions.

## Dependencies

The phases are designed with the following dependencies:

1. Core infrastructure (Phases 000-003) must be implemented first to provide the foundation for feature development
2. The CLI Analysis Engine (Phase 004) is required before implementing the Test Plan Generator (Phase 005)
3. Docker Test Execution (Phase 006) depends on Test Plan Generator (Phase 005)
4. AI Result Verification (Phase 007) requires Docker Test Execution (Phase 006)
5. Model Flexibility (Phase 008) can be developed in parallel with Phases 004-007
6. Reporting System (Phase 009) depends on AI Result Verification (Phase 007)
7. Integration & Release (Phase 010) depends on all previous phases

## Development Timeline

Based on the implementation plan in the PRD and domain knowledge:

1. **Phases 000-003 (Infrastructure)**: 2 weeks
2. **Phase 004 (CLI Analysis Engine)**: 2 weeks
3. **Phase 005 (Test Plan Generator)**: 2 weeks
4. **Phase 006 (Docker Test Execution)**: 1 week
5. **Phase 007 (AI Result Verification)**: 2 weeks
6. **Phase 008 (Model Flexibility)**: 1 week (can be developed in parallel)
7. **Phase 009 (Reporting System)**: 1 week
8. **Phase 010 (Integration & Release)**: 1 week

Total timeline: Approximately 10 weeks for MVP completion.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy follows a test-driven development approach across all phases:

1. **Unit Testing**: For all components and modules using pytest
2. **Integration Testing**: For component interactions
3. **End-to-End Testing**: For complete workflows
4. **Dogfooding**: Using Testronaut to test itself once core functionality is implemented
5. **Performance Testing**: To ensure the system operates within acceptable time constraints
6. **Security Testing**: Particularly for Docker containerization and API integrations

Each phase will include specific test plans that must pass before the phase is considered complete. Test coverage will be monitored and should maintain a minimum threshold of 80% across the codebase.
