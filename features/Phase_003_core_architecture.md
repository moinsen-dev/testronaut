# Phase 003: Core Architecture

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Database Models and Migrations | ❌ Not Started |
| Component Interfaces | ❌ Not Started |
| Error Handling Framework | ❌ Not Started |
| Logging and Monitoring | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
Before implementing specific features, we need to establish the core architecture that will serve as the foundation for the entire system. This phase defines the data models, component interfaces, error handling, and logging systems that all other components will rely on. A well-designed core architecture ensures consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the application.

## Goal
Create a robust core architecture that defines the data models, component interfaces, error handling strategy, and logging framework for the Testronaut application. This architecture will provide a solid foundation for implementing the specific features in subsequent phases.

## Architecture
The core architecture consists of several key components:

### Data Models
```
models/
├── base.py             # Base model classes and utilities
├── cli_tool.py         # CLI tool and command models
├── test_plan.py        # Test plan and test case models
├── test_result.py      # Test execution result models
└── test_report.py      # Test report and analysis models
```

### Component Interfaces
```
interfaces/
├── analyzer.py         # CLI analysis interface
├── generator.py        # Test generation interface
├── executor.py         # Test execution interface
├── verifier.py         # Result verification interface
└── reporter.py         # Report generation interface
```

### Error Handling and Logging
```
utils/
├── errors.py           # Custom exceptions and error handlers
├── logging.py          # Logging configuration and utilities
├── validation.py       # Input validation utilities
└── monitoring.py       # Performance and health monitoring
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Database Models and Migrations
1. Design SQLModel-based data models for all entities
2. Implement relationships between models
3. Create database connection and session management
4. Set up Alembic for database migrations
5. Implement initial migration script

### 2. Component Interfaces
1. Define interface protocols for core components
2. Implement base classes for common functionality
3. Create factory classes for component instantiation
4. Set up dependency injection framework
5. Document interface contracts

### 3. Error Handling Framework
1. Design custom exception hierarchy
2. Implement global error handlers
3. Create error logging and reporting utilities
4. Set up error recovery mechanisms
5. Implement user-friendly error messages

### 4. Logging and Monitoring
1. Configure structured logging system
2. Implement context-aware logging
3. Create performance monitoring utilities
4. Set up health check endpoints
5. Implement telemetry collection

## Related Systems
This core architecture interacts with:
- SQLite database for data persistence
- Docker for containerization
- LLM services for AI features
- CLI interface for user interaction

## Related Features
This architecture provides the foundation for:
- All subsequent feature phases (004-010)
- Integration between components
- Data persistence and retrieval
- System observability

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Database Model Tests**
   - Test model creation and validation
   - Test relationship navigation
   - Test query operations
   - Test migration execution

2. **Component Interface Tests**
   - Test interface contract compliance
   - Test factory class functionality
   - Test dependency injection
   - Test interface extension

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test exception handling
   - Test error reporting
   - Test recovery mechanisms
   - Test user error messages

4. **Logging and Monitoring Tests**
   - Test log generation and formatting
   - Test contextual logging
   - Test performance metrics collection
   - Test health check functionality

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Start with defining interfaces before implementation
2. Use abstract base classes to enforce contracts
3. Implement comprehensive data validation
4. Create reusable utilities for common operations
5. Ensure all components follow established patterns

### Test Verification
1. Verify model operations with test database
2. Check interface compliance with mock implementations
3. Trigger error conditions and verify handling
4. Generate logs and verify format and content

### Testing Iteration
1. Implement minimal interfaces first
2. Add functionality incrementally
3. Refine interfaces based on usage patterns
4. Optimize performance of critical operations
