# Phase 009: Reporting System

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Test Report Generator | ❌ Not Started |
| Visualization Components | ❌ Not Started |
| Failure Analysis | ❌ Not Started |
| Recommendations Engine | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
After tests are executed and results are verified, users need comprehensive reporting to understand test outcomes, identify patterns, analyze failures, and make improvements. The Reporting System transforms raw test results into actionable insights, helping users understand test coverage, identify issues, and improve their CLI tools.

## Goal
Create a comprehensive reporting system that generates detailed test reports, visualizes test results, analyzes failure patterns, and provides recommendations for improvements to both test plans and CLI tools.

## Architecture
The Reporting System consists of these components:

```
reporting/
├── generator/
│   ├── report_generator.py     # Generates comprehensive reports
│   ├── summary_generator.py    # Creates executive summaries
│   └── export_generator.py     # Exports reports in various formats
├── visualization/
│   ├── result_visualizer.py    # Visualizes test results
│   ├── coverage_visualizer.py  # Shows test coverage metrics
│   └── trend_visualizer.py     # Displays historical trends
├── analysis/
│   ├── failure_analyzer.py     # Analyzes test failures
│   ├── pattern_detector.py     # Detects failure patterns
│   └── root_cause_analyzer.py  # Identifies root causes
└── recommendations/
    ├── test_recommender.py     # Recommends test improvements
    ├── tool_recommender.py     # Suggests CLI tool improvements
    └── priority_analyzer.py    # Prioritizes recommendations
```

2. Create pattern detection for common failures
3. Develop root cause analysis algorithms
4. Build failure impact assessment
5. Implement historical failure analysis

### 4. Recommendations Engine
1. Design AI-assisted recommendation system
2. Implement test improvement suggestions
3. Create CLI tool improvement recommendations
4. Develop prioritization algorithms
5. Build recommendation tracking

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- Test Result Repository for data sources
- LLM Manager for AI-assisted analysis
