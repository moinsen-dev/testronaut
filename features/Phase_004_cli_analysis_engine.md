# Phase 004: CLI Analysis Engine

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Help Text Parser | ❌ Not Started |
| Command Structure Analyzer | ❌ Not Started |
| Command Relationship Detector | ❌ Not Started |
| AI-Based Command Semantics Analyzer | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
The CLI Analysis Engine is a core feature of Testronaut that enables the automated analysis of command-line tools. This component extracts the structure, options, arguments, and semantics of CLI commands, providing the foundation for test plan generation. The quality and depth of this analysis directly impacts the effectiveness of the generated tests.

## Goal
Create a robust CLI Analysis Engine that can automatically parse CLI tool structures, extract command syntax, identify relationships between commands, and leverage AI to understand command semantics and usage patterns.

## Architecture
The CLI Analysis Engine consists of several subcomponents that work together:

```
analyzer/
├── parser/
│   ├── help_parser.py        # Parses help text for commands
│   ├── man_parser.py         # Parses man pages if available
│   └── output_parser.py      # Parses command outputs
├── extractor/
│   ├── option_extractor.py   # Extracts command options
│   ├── arg_extractor.py      # Extracts command arguments
│   └── syntax_extractor.py   # Extracts command syntax
├── relationship/
│   ├── command_graph.py      # Builds command relationship graph
│   └── dependency_analyzer.py # Analyzes command dependencies
└── semantic/
    ├── llm_analyzer.py       # Uses LLMs for semantic analysis
    ├── prompts.py            # LLM prompts for analysis
    └── result_processor.py   # Processes LLM responses
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Help Text Parser
1. Implement command execution to collect help text
2. Create patterns for common help text formats
3. Develop parsers for different CLI conventions
4. Extract command names, descriptions, and usage
5. Handle nested and hierarchical commands

### 2. Command Structure Analyzer
1. Build option and flag extraction logic
2. Implement argument identification
3. Create syntax pattern recognition
4. Develop type inference for arguments
5. Handle complex option formats and patterns

### 3. Command Relationship Detector
1. Create command dependency analysis
2. Build command hierarchy visualization
3. Implement workflow and sequence detection
4. Develop command graph representation
5. Create relationship metadata storage

### 4. AI-Based Command Semantics Analyzer
1. Design LLM prompts for command analysis
2. Implement LLM integration for semantic understanding
3. Create result parsing and validation
4. Develop confidence scoring for AI analyses
5. Implement feedback mechanism for improving analyses

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- LLM Manager for AI-powered analysis
- Database for storing analysis results
- Docker for executing commands in isolated environments
- CLI Interface for user interaction

## Related Features
This phase provides inputs for:
- Phase 005: Test Plan Generator (depends on CLI analysis)
- Phase 008: Model Flexibility (LLM integration)

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Help Text Parser Tests**
   - Test parsing help text from various CLI tools
   - Test extraction of command names and descriptions
   - Test handling of different help text formats
   - Test parsing of nested and complex command structures

2. **Command Structure Analyzer Tests**
   - Test option and flag extraction
   - Test argument identification and typing
   - Test syntax pattern recognition
   - Test handling of edge cases and complex formats

3. **Command Relationship Detector Tests**
   - Test command dependency identification
   - Test hierarchy construction
   - Test relationship graph generation
   - Test relationship metadata accuracy

4. **AI-Based Semantics Analyzer Tests**
   - Test LLM prompt effectiveness
   - Test semantic analysis accuracy
   - Test confidence scoring
   - Test feedback incorporation

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Start with common CLI patterns and formats
2. Use real-world CLI tools for testing and validation
3. Implement flexible parsers that can handle various conventions
4. Leverage AI for ambiguous or complex cases
5. Ensure robust error handling for unexpected formats

### Test Verification
1. Compare parsed results with manually analyzed examples
2. Verify that all command components are correctly identified
3. Check relationship graphs for accuracy
4. Validate semantic analyses against expert knowledge

### Testing Iteration
1. Start with simple CLI tools with well-defined patterns
2. Gradually add support for more complex and unusual formats
3. Use real user feedback to improve parsers
4. Continuously refine AI prompts based on analysis results
