# Phase 000: Project Setup

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: 🚧 In Progress

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Project Structure and Configuration | 🚧 In Progress |
| Dependency Management | 🚧 In Progress |
| Development Environment Setup | ❌ Not Started |
| Initial CLI Interface | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
This phase establishes the foundation for the entire Testronaut project. Before any feature development can begin, we need a proper project structure, dependency management, development environment, and initial CLI interface. This work provides the scaffold on which all future development will build.

## Goal
Create a fully configured development environment with appropriate project structure, dependency management, and initial CLI interface that will allow the team to efficiently implement and test the core features of Testronaut.

## Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
testronaut/
├── cli/            # Command-line interface modules
├── core/           # Core business logic
│   ├── analyzer/   # CLI tool analysis components
│   ├── generator/  # Test plan generation components
│   ├── executor/   # Test execution components
│   ├── verifier/   # Result verification components
│   └── models/     # Data models
├── db/             # Database management
├── llm/            # LLM integration components
├── docker/         # Docker integration components
└── utils/          # Utility functions
```

This architecture aligns with the domain-driven design approach, organizing code around business domains rather than technical concerns.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Project Structure and Configuration
1. Set up the project repository with appropriate `.gitignore` and `README.md`
2. Create the modular directory structure as outlined in the architecture
3. Configure `pyproject.toml` with build system, project metadata, and dependencies
4. Set up code style and analysis tools: `black`, `isort`, `mypy`

### 2. Dependency Management
1. Define core dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
2. Set up virtual environment management with `uv`
3. Create dependency groups for development, testing, and documentation
4. Configure dependency pinning strategy for reproducible builds

### 3. Development Environment Setup
1. Create development container configuration for VSCode
2. Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
3. Configure editor settings for consistent code formatting
4. Create documentation for local development setup

### 4. Initial CLI Interface
1. Implement the base CLI application using Typer
2. Create command structure and help text
3. Implement logging and error handling
4. Add initial commands (without implementation) for the basic workflow:
   - `analyze`: Analyze CLI tool
   - `generate`: Generate test plan
   - `verify`: Verify test results
   - `report`: Generate test report

## Related Systems
This phase sets up the integration points with:
- Docker for containerization
- SQLite for data storage
- LLM services for AI capabilities
- CI/CD systems for automation

## Related Features
This phase provides the foundation for:
- Phase 001: Testing Infrastructure
- Phase 002: CI/CD Pipeline
- Phase 003: Core Architecture

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Project Structure Tests**
   - Test that all required directories exist
   - Test that `__init__.py` files are present where needed
   - Test imports of core modules

2. **Configuration Tests**
   - Test that configuration files are valid
   - Test that environment variables are properly loaded
   - Test configuration overrides and defaults

3. **Dependency Tests**
   - Test that all required dependencies can be installed
   - Test that version conflicts are resolved correctly
   - Test virtual environment isolation

4. **CLI Interface Tests**
   - Test that CLI commands are registered correctly
   - Test help text and command documentation
   - Test argument parsing and validation
   - Test error handling and user feedback

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Start with test implementation first
2. Implement the minimal code required to make tests pass
3. Refactor for clarity and maintainability
4. Add documentation comments
5. Review and approve through pull requests

### Test Verification
1. Run `pytest` to execute all tests
2. Ensure 100% test coverage for critical components
3. Verify test failures correctly identify issues
4. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Iteration
1. Implement one component at a time, starting with tests
2. Get feedback from team members on implementations
3. Refine tests based on discovered edge cases
4. Update implementation to handle edge cases
5. Repeat until all tests pass consistently

## Issues Tracker

| ID | Description | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 001 | Set up project directory structure | 🚧 In Progress | High | Need to align with domain-driven design principles |
| 002 | Configure dependency management | 🚧 In Progress | High | Evaluating uv vs. pip for package management |
| 003 | Implement CLI interface scaffold | ❌ Not Started | Medium | Waiting for project structure to be finalized |
