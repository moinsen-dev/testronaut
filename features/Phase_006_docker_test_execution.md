# Phase 006: Docker Test Execution

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Container Management | ❌ Not Started |
| CLI Tool Installation | ❌ Not Started |
| Command Execution | ❌ Not Started |
| Output Capture System | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
Testronaut executes tests in isolated Docker containers to ensure consistent, reproducible test environments and to protect the host system from potentially harmful commands. This phase implements the Docker-based test execution system that runs the test plans generated in Phase 005, captures outputs, and prepares results for verification.

## Goal
Create a robust Docker-based test execution system that can reliably install CLI tools in isolated containers, execute test commands according to the test plan, capture all relevant outputs (stdout, stderr, exit codes, and files), and prepare these outputs for verification.

## Architecture
The Docker Test Execution system consists of these components:

```
executor/
├── container/
│   ├── manager.py         # Docker container lifecycle management
│   ├── image.py           # Docker image management
│   └── network.py         # Container networking
├── installation/
│   ├── installer.py       # CLI tool installation logic
│   ├── verifier.py        # Installation verification
│   └── strategies.py      # Different installation strategies
├── execution/
│   ├── runner.py          # Command execution engine
│   ├── scheduler.py       # Test execution scheduling
│   └── context.py         # Execution context management
└── capture/
    ├── stdout_capture.py  # Standard output capture
    ├── stderr_capture.py  # Error output capture
    ├── file_capture.py    # File system changes capture
    └── processor.py       # Output processing and storage
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Container Management
1. Implement Docker API integration
2. Create container lifecycle management
3. Develop image caching and reuse
4. Build resource limitation controls
5. Implement security configuration

### 2. CLI Tool Installation
1. Create installation strategies for different tool types
2. Implement installation verification
3. Develop dependency resolution
4. Build installation logging
5. Create installation retries and error handling

### 3. Command Execution
1. Implement command formatting and execution
2. Create execution context management
3. Develop command sequence handling
4. Build timeout and resource monitoring
5. Implement error handling and recovery

### 4. Output Capture System
1. Create stdout and stderr capture
2. Implement exit code handling
3. Develop file system change monitoring
4. Build output processing and normalization
5. Implement artifact storage and management

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- Docker for container management
- Test Plan Generator for test plan execution
- Database for storing test results
- File System for storing test artifacts

## Related Features
This phase provides inputs for:
- Phase 007: AI Result Verification (uses captured outputs)
- Phase 009: Reporting System (execution results)

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **Container Management Tests**
   - Test container creation and deletion
   - Test image management
   - Test resource limitations
   - Test security configurations

2. **CLI Tool Installation Tests**
   - Test installation strategies for different tools
   - Test installation verification
   - Test dependency resolution
   - Test error handling

3. **Command Execution Tests**
   - Test command formatting and execution
   - Test context management
   - Test sequence handling
   - Test timeout and monitoring

4. **Output Capture Tests**
   - Test stdout and stderr capture
   - Test exit code handling
   - Test file system monitoring
   - Test artifact storage

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Use Docker SDK for Python for container management
2. Implement proper resource cleanup and isolation
3. Create robust error handling for all Docker operations
4. Design the system to be resilient to Docker failures
5. Ensure all outputs are captured completely and accurately

### Test Verification
1. Execute test plans in Docker containers
2. Verify that all outputs are captured correctly
3. Check resource management and limitations
4. Ensure clean startup and shutdown of containers

### Testing Iteration
1. Start with basic container management
2. Add tool installation capabilities
3. Implement command execution
4. Develop comprehensive output capture
5. Optimize for performance and reliability
