# Phase 002: CI/CD Pipeline

## Phase Status
**Overall Status**: ❌ Not Started

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| GitHub Actions Workflow | ❌ Not Started |
| Automated Testing | ❌ Not Started |
| Packaging and Distribution | ❌ Not Started |
| Documentation Generation | ❌ Not Started |

## Context
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is crucial for maintaining code quality, ensuring tests pass, and delivering working software reliably. For Testronaut, a tool designed to improve testing workflows, having a robust CI/CD pipeline is especially important. This phase establishes the automation infrastructure that will support the entire development lifecycle.

## Goal
Create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that automates testing, validation, packaging, and deployment of the Testronaut application. This pipeline will ensure that code changes are automatically verified, packaged properly, and can be deployed to production environments with confidence.

## Architecture
The CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using GitHub Actions and will consist of several workflows:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── test.yml           # Run tests on PRs and pushes
    ├── lint.yml           # Code quality checks
    ├── build.yml          # Build and package the application
    ├── release.yml        # Create releases and publish to PyPI
    └── docs.yml           # Generate and deploy documentation
```

The workflows will be integrated with the repository's branching strategy and will execute appropriate actions based on git events.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Configure GitHub repository settings for branch protection
2. Create workflow files for different CI/CD stages
3. Set up environment configuration for different stages
4. Configure workflow triggers based on events
5. Implement workflow dependencies and sequencing

### 2. Automated Testing
1. Create workflow for running unit tests
2. Set up integration test automation
3. Configure functional test execution
4. Implement test result reporting
5. Set up matrix testing for different Python versions

### 3. Packaging and Distribution
1. Create workflow for building Python packages
2. Configure PyPI publishing for releases
3. Set up Docker image building and publishing
4. Implement version management
5. Configure release notes generation

### 4. Documentation Generation
1. Set up MkDocs for documentation generation
2. Create workflow for building documentation
3. Configure GitHub Pages for documentation hosting
4. Implement API documentation generation
5. Set up automated changelog management

## Related Systems
This phase integrates with:
- GitHub repository and actions
- PyPI for package distribution
- Docker Hub for container distribution
- Documentation hosting platforms

## Related Features
This phase supports:
- All development phases with continuous testing
- Release management for Phase 010
- Quality assurance throughout development

## Test-Driven Development Plan

### Test Cases
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Tests**
   - Test that workflows are triggered correctly
   - Test workflow input validation
   - Test workflow state persistence
   - Test workflow notifications

2. **Automated Testing Tests**
   - Test that all test types are executed
   - Test result aggregation and reporting
   - Test matrix strategy execution
   - Test failure handling and reporting

3. **Packaging and Distribution Tests**
   - Test package building correctness
   - Test package installation
   - Test Docker image building
   - Test version management

4. **Documentation Generation Tests**
   - Test documentation building
   - Test API documentation extraction
   - Test documentation deployment
   - Test changelog generation

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Start with minimal workflows and expand incrementally
2. Use GitHub's workflow testing capabilities
3. Implement workflows one at a time, verifying each works correctly
4. Ensure error handling and reporting is robust
5. Document each workflow's purpose and operation

### Test Verification
1. Run workflows on feature branches
2. Verify that all steps execute correctly
3. Check that artifacts are generated as expected
4. Confirm that error conditions are handled properly

### Testing Iteration
1. Start with basic workflow configurations
2. Test each workflow in isolation
3. Integrate workflows and verify interactions
4. Gather feedback from team and refine

## Issues Tracker

| ID | Description | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| 001 | Set up basic GitHub Actions workflows | ❌ Not Started | High | Need to establish repository settings first |
| 002 | Configure test execution in CI | ❌ Not Started | High | Depends on Phase 001 completion |
| 003 | Set up package building and publishing | ❌ Not Started | Medium | Need to establish versioning strategy |
| 004 | Configure documentation generation and hosting | ❌ Not Started | Medium | Need to decide on documentation framework |
